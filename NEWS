Date        Modules         Changes

2008-06-10  execute         The execute function takes an additional termsigp
                            argument. Passing termsigp = NULL is ok.
            wait-process    The wait_subprocess function takes an additional
                            termsigp argument. Passing termsigp = NULL is ok.

2008-05-10  linebreak       The module is split into several modules unilbrk/*.
                            The include file is changed from "linebreak.h" to
                            "unilbrk.h". Two functions are renamed:
                            mbs_possible_linebreaks -> ulc_possible_linebreaks
                            mbs_width_linebreaks -> ulc_width_linebreaks

2008-04-28  rpmatch         The include file is now <stdlib.h>.

2008-04-28  inet_ntop       The include file is changed from "inet_ntop.h"
                            to <arpa/inet.h>.

2008-04-28  inet_pton       The include file is changed from "inet_pton.h"
                            to <arpa/inet.h>.

2008-03-06  freadahead      The return value's computation has changed. It
                            now increases by 1 after ungetc.

2008-01-26  isnan-nolibm    The module name is changed from isnan-nolibm to
                            isnand-nolibm. The include file is changed from
                            "isnan.h" to "isnand.h". The function that it
                            defines is changed from isnan() to isnand().

2008-01-14  strcasestr      This module now replaces worst-case inefficient
                            implementations; clients that use controlled
                            needles and thus do not care about worst-case
                            efficiency should use the new strcasestr-simple
                            module instead for smaller code size.

2008-01-09  alloca-opt      Now defines HAVE_ALLOCA_H only when the system
                            supplies an <alloca.h>.  Gnulib-using code is now
                            expected to include <alloca.h> unconditionally.
                            Non-gnulib-using code can continue to include
                            <alloca.h> only if HAVE_ALLOCA_H is defined.

2008-01-08  memmem          This module now replaces worst-case inefficient
                            implementations; clients that use controlled
                            needles and thus do not care about worst-case
                            efficiency should use the new memmem-simple
                            module instead for smaller code size.

2007-12-24  setenv          The include file is changed from "setenv.h" to
                            <stdlib.h>. Also, the unsetenv function is no
                            longer declared in this module; use the 'unsetenv'
                            module if you need it.

2007-12-03  getpagesize     The include file is changed from "getpagesize.h"
                            to <unistd.h>.

2007-12-03  strcase         The include file is changed from <string.h> to
                            <strings.h>.

2007-10-07  most modules    The license for most modules has changed from
                            GPLv2+ to GPLv3+, and from LGPLv2+ to LGPLv3+.
                            A few modules are still under LGPLv2+; see the
                            module description for the applicable license.

2007-09-01  linebreak       "linebreak.h" no longer declares the functions
                            locale_charset, uc_width, u{8,16,32}_width. Use
                            "uniwidth.h" to get these functions declared.

2007-08-28  areadlink-with-size
                            Renamed from mreadlink-with-size.
                            Function renamed: mreadlink_with_size ->
                            areadlink_with_size.

2007-08-22  getdelim, getline
                            The include file is changed from "getdelim.h"
                            and "getline.h" to the POSIX 200x <stdio.h>.

2007-08-18  idcache         Now provides prototypes in "idcache.h".

2007-08-10  xstrtol         The STRTOL_FATAL_ERROR macro is removed.
                            Use the new xstrtol_fatal function instead.

2007-08-04  human           The function human_options no longer reports an
                            error to standard error; that is now the
                            caller's responsibility.  It returns an
                            error code of type enum strtol_error
                            instead of the integer option value, and stores
                            the option value via a new int * argument.
            xstrtol         The first two arguments of STRTOL_FATAL_ERROR
                            are now an option name and option argument
                            instead of an option argument and a type string,
                            STRTOL_FAIL_WARN is removed.

2007-07-14  gpl, lgpl       New Texinfo versions with no sectioning commands.

2007-07-10  version-etc     Output now mentions GPLv3+, not GPLv2+.  Use
                            gnulib-tool --local-dir to override this.

2007-07-07  wcwidth         The include file is changed from "wcwidth.h" to
                            <wchar.h>.

2007-07-02  gpl, lgpl       Renamed to gpl-2.0 and lgpl-2.1 respectively.
                            (There is also a new module gpl-3.0.)

2007-06-16  lchown          The include file is changed from "lchown.h" to
                            <unistd.h>.

2007-06-09  xallocsa        Renamed to xmalloca. The include file "xallocsa.h"
                            was remamed to "xmalloca.h". The function was
                            renamed:
                              xallocsa -> xmalloca

2007-06-09  allocsa         Renamed to malloca. The include file "allocsa.h"
                            was remamed to "malloca.h". The function-like
                            macros were renamed:
                              allocsa -> malloca
                              freesa -> freea

2007-05-20  utimens         Renamed futimens to gl_futimens, to avoid
                            conflict with the glibc-2.6-introduced function
                            that has a different signature.

2007-05-01  sigprocmask     The module now depends on signal, so replace
                              #include "sigprocmask.h"
                            with
                              #include <signal.h>

2007-04-06  gettext         The macro HAVE_LONG_DOUBLE is no longer set.
                            You can replace all its uses with 1, i.e. assume
                            'long double' as a type exists.

2007-04-01  arcfour         Renamed to crypto/arcfour.

2007-03-27  vasprintf       The module now depends on stdio, so replace
                               #include "vasprintf.h"
                            with

            utf8-ucs4-unsafe  The include file is changed from
                            "utf8-ucs4-unsafe.h" to "unistr.h".
            utf16-ucs4      The include file is changed from "utf16-ucs4.h"
                            to "unistr.h".

                            to "unistr.h".

2007-03-19  iconvme         The module is removed. Use module striconv instead:
                            iconv_string -> str_iconv
                            iconv_alloc -> str_cd_iconv (with reversed
                                           arguments)

2007-03-15  list            The functions gl_list_create_empty and
            array-list      gl_list_create now take an extra fourth argument.
            carray-list     You can pass NULL.
            linked-list
            linkedhash-list
            avltree-list
            rbtree-list
            avltreehash-list
            rbtreehash-list

2007-03-15  oset            The function gl_oset_create_empty now takes a
            array-oset      third argument. You can pass NULL.
            avltree-oset
            rbtree-oset

2007-03-12  des             The types and functions in lib/des.h have been
            gc-des          renamed:

                            des_ctx -> gl_des_ctx, tripledes_ctx -> gl_3des_ctx,
                            des_is_weak_key -> gl_des_is_weak_key,
                            des_setkey -> gl_des_setkey,
                            des_makekey -> gl_des_makekey,
                            des_ecb_crypt -> gl_des_ecb_crypt,
                            des_ecb_encrypt -> gl_des_ecb_encrypt,
                            des_ecb_decrypt -> gl_des_ecb_decrypt,
                            tripledes_set2keys -> gl_3des_set2keys,
                            tripledes_set3keys -> gl_3des_set3keys,
                            tripledes_makekey -> gl_3des_makekey,
                            tripledes_ecb_crypt -> gl_3des_ecb_crypt.

                            Also consider using the "gc-des" buffer instead of
                            using the "des" module directly.

2007-02-28  xreadlink       The module xreadlink was renamed to
                            xreadlink-with-size. The function was renamed:
                            xreadlink -> xreadlink_with_size.

2007-02-18  exit            The modules now depend on stdlib, so replace
            mkdtemp           #include "exit.h"
            mkstemp           #include "mkdtemp.h"
                              #include "mkstemp.h"
                            with
                              #include <stdlib.h>

2007-01-26  strdup          The module now depends on string, so replace
                              #include "strdup.h"
                            with
                              #include <string.h>

# This is for Emacs.
# Local Variables:
# indent-tabs-mode: nil
# whitespace-check-buffer-indent: nil
# End:

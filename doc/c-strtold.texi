The @code{c-strtold} module contains a string to number (@samp{long double})
conversion function operating on single-byte character strings, that operates
as if the locale encoding was ASCII.
(The "C" locale on many systems has the locale encoding "ASCII".)

The function is:
@smallexample
extern long double c_strtold (const char *string, char **endp);
@end smallexample

In particular, only a period @samp{.} is accepted as decimal point, even
when the current locale's notion of decimal point is a comma @samp{,}.

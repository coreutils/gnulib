@item
This function is missing on some platforms:
glibc 2.3.6, MacOS X 10.5, FreeBSD 6.0, NetBSD 5.0, OpenBSD 3.8, Minix 3.1.8,
AIX 5.1, HP-UX 11, IRIX 6.5, OSF/1 5.1, Cygwin 1.5.x, mingw, MSVC 9, Interix 3.5, BeOS.
But the replacement function is not safe to be used in libraries and is not multithread-safe.
@item
On platforms where @code{off_t} is a 32-bit type, @code{open} may not work
correctly with files larger than 2 GB.  (Cf. @code{AC_SYS_LARGEFILE}.)
@item
This function does not fail when the file name argument ends in a slash
and (without the slash) names a nonexistent file or a file that is not a
directory, on some platforms:
Solaris 9.

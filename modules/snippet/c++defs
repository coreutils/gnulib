# The BUILT_SOURCES created by this Makefile snippet are not used via #include
# statements but through direct file reference. Therefore this snippet must be
# present in all Makefile.am that need it. This is ensured by the applicability
# 'all' defined above.

# The c++defs.h that gets inserted into generated .h files is the same as

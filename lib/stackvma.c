   smaller than the file's contents:
     - On NetBSD, the second read() call would return 0, thus making the file
       appear truncated.
     - On DragonFly BSD, the first read() call would fail with errno = EFBIG.
     - On all platforms, if some other thread is doing memory allocations or
       deallocations between two read() calls, there is a high risk that the
       result of these two read() calls don't fit together, and as a
       consequence we will parse garbage and either omit some VMAs or return
       VMAs with nonsensical addresses.
   So use mmap(), and ignore the resulting VMA.

/* =========================== stackvma-mincore.c =========================== */

/* mincore() is a system call that allows to inquire the status of a
   range of pages of virtual memory.  In particular, it allows to inquire
   whether a page is mapped at all (except on Mac OS X, where mincore
   returns 0 even for unmapped addresses).
   As of 2006, mincore() is supported by:        possible bits:
     - Linux,   since Linux 2.4 and glibc 2.2,   1
     - Solaris, since Solaris 9,                 1
     - MacOS X, since MacOS X 10.3 (at least),   1
     - FreeBSD, since FreeBSD 6.0,               MINCORE_{INCORE,REFERENCED,MODIFIED}
     - NetBSD,  since NetBSD 3.0 (at least),     1
     - OpenBSD, since OpenBSD 2.6 (at least),    1
     - AIX,     since AIX 5.3,                   1
   As of 2019, also on
     - Hurd.
   However, while the API allows to easily determine the bounds of mapped
   virtual memory, it does not make it easy to find the bounds of _unmapped_
   virtual memory ranges.  We try to work around this, but it may still be
   slow.  */

         mach_vm_address_t and mach_vm_size_t are always 64 bits large.
         MacOS X 10.5 has three vm_region like methods:
           - vm_region. It has arguments that depend on whether the current
             process is 32-bit or 64-bit. When linking dynamically, this
             function exists only in 32-bit processes. Therefore we use it only
             in 32-bit processes.
           - vm_region_64. It has arguments that depend on whether the current
             process is 32-bit or 64-bit. It interprets a flavor
             VM_REGION_BASIC_INFO as VM_REGION_BASIC_INFO_64, which is
             dangerous since 'struct vm_region_basic_info_64' is larger than
             'struct vm_region_basic_info'; therefore let's write
             VM_REGION_BASIC_INFO_64 explicitly.
           - mach_vm_region. It has arguments that are 64-bit always. This
             function is useful when you want to access the VM of a process
             other than the current process.
         In 64-bit processes, we could use vm_region_64 or mach_vm_region.

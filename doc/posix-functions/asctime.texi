@item
This function is deprecated in C23.
Likewise, POSIX says this function is obsolescent and it is planned to be
removed in a future version.
Portable applications can use @code{strftime} (or even @code{sprintf}) instead.
However, @code{strftime} is locale dependent.
@item
This function may overflow its internal buffer if its argument
specifies a year before 1000 or after 9999.

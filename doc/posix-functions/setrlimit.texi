Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:

This function is missing on some platforms:
Minix 3.1.8, mingw, MSVC 9, BeOS.
@item
On platforms where @code{rlim_t} is a 32-bit type, this function does not
allow to set limits larger than 4 GB, such as for RLIMIT_FSIZE.  The fix is
to use the @code{AC_SYS_LARGEFILE} macro.

Gnulib module: stddef

Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
Some platforms fail to provide @code{max_align_t}, which was added in C11.

@item
Some old platforms fail to provide @code{wchar_t}.

@item
Some platforms provide a @code{NULL} macro that cannot be used in arbitrary
expressions:
NetBSD 5.0
@end itemize

Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
Some platforms provide an @code{offsetof} macro that cannot be used in
arbitrary expressions:
Solaris 11 2011-11
This problem can be worked around by parenthesizing the
@code{offsetof} expression in the unlikely case you use it with
@code{sizeof} or @samp{[]}.
@end itemize

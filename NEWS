Important general notes
-----------------------

Date        Modules         Changes

2022-07-24  bootstrap       To specify a reference directory for the 'gnulib'
                            submodule, use the environment variable
                            GNULIB_REFDIR instead of GNULIB_SRCDIR or the
                            command-line option --gnulib-refdir instead of
                            --gnulib-srcdir.

2022-02-20  (all)           Automake >= 1.14 and Autoconf >= 2.64 are required.

2021-06-04  (all)           The license notices in source files are now really
                            stating the effective license, rather than a fake
                            GPL notice.
                            gnulib-tool no longer replaces GPL notices in source
                            files by something else.

2020-08-16  (all)           Automake >= 1.11 and Autoconf >= 2.64 are required.

2019-12-11  Support for     These modules are now supported in C++ mode as well.
            ISO C or POSIX  This means, while the autoconfiguration uses the C
            functions       compiler, the resulting header files and function
                            substitutes can be used with a matching C++ compiler
                            as well.

2019-02-14  gnulib-tool     If you use multiple --local-dir options at once:
                            The first one now has the highest priority, not the
                            last one.

2019-01-04  (all)           The meaning of the 'Link' section in the module
                            descriptions has been clarified: It overrides the
                            combined 'Link' sections from the dependencies.

2018-10-22  (all)           Automake >= 1.11 and Autoconf >= 2.63 are required.

2016-09-05  progname        There is now an alternate module 'getprogname'. It
                            defines a getprogname() function; use it to obtain
                            the name of the current program.
                            Recommended use:
                            - In a program's main() function, and associated
                              usage() and help() functions, use 'progname'.
                            - In library code, or more generally any code that
                              is not near the main() function, use
                              'getprogname'.

2013-04-24  gettext         If your project uses 'gettextize --intl' it is now
                            your responsibility to put -I$(top_builddir)/intl
                            into the Makefile.am for gnulib.

2012-06-27  elisp-comp      The module 'elisp-comp' is removed; the script is
                            not independently useful outside of automake.

2012-06-21  gnulib-tool     The option --with-tests is now implied by the
                            options --create-testdir, --test,
                            --create-megatestdir, --megatest.

2012-01-07  quotearg        In the C locale, the function will no longer use
                            the grave accent character to begin a quoted
                            string (`like this').  It will use apostrophes
                            'like these' or, in Unicode locales, single quotes
                            ‘like these’.  You may want to adjust any error
                            messages that hard code the quoting characters.

2010-09-04  gnulib-tool     The option '--import' is no longer cumulative; it
                            now expects the complete list of modules and other
                            options on the command line. If you want to
                            augment (not set) the list of modules, use the
                            new option '--add-import' instead of '--import'.

---------------------------------

Date        Modules         Changes

2022-03-09  statat          This module is deprecated.  Use fstatat instead.

2022-01-05  stack           This module now uses idx_t instead of size_t
                            for indexes and counts.

2021-08-27  base32          These modules now use idx_t instead of size_t
            base64          for indexes and counts.

2021-07-29  (all)           Due to draft C2x, the following attributes should
                            now appear at the start of a function declaration:
                              _GL_ATTRIBUTE_DEPRECATED
                              _GL_ATTRIBUTE_MAYBE_UNUSED
                              _GL_ATTRIBUTE_NODISCARD
            attribute       Likewise for DEPRECATED, MAYBE_UNUSED, NODISCARD.
            snippet/unused-parameter
                            Likewise for _GL_UNUSED_PARAMETER.

2021-07-01  largefile       AC_SYS_LARGEFILE now also arranges for time_t
                            to be 64-bit on 32-bit GNU/Linux platforms
                            that support it (glibc 2.34 or later).

2021-03-21  fatal-signal    The function at_fatal_signal now returns an error
                            indicator.

2021-03-21  diacrit         This deprecated module is removed.

2021-03-07  mbrtowc         For single-locale optimizations, you now need to
            mbrtoc32        define GNULIB_WCHAR_SINGLE_LOCALE instead of
            wcwidth         GNULIB_WCHAR_SINGLE.

2021-02-28  parse-datetime  The parse_datetime2 function has been moved
                            to the new parse-datetime2 module, so that
                            programs that need just parse_datetime need
                            not build the fancier function.

2020-12-23  execute         These functions no longer execute scripts without
            spawn-pipe      '#!' marker through /bin/sh. To execute such a
            posix_spawn     script as a shell script, either add a '#!/bin/sh'
            posix_spawnp    marker in the first line, or specify "/bin/sh" as
                            the program to execute and the script as its first
                            argument.

2020-12-18  free            This module, obsoleted in 2008, is gone.

2020-12-14  findprog-in     The function 'find_in_given_path' now takes a 3rd
                            argument 'const char *directory'. To maintain the
                            previous behaviour, insert NULL as additional 3rd
                            argument.

2020-12-11  sh-quote        The argv argument of the 'shell_quote_argv' function
                            is now of type 'const char * const *'.  You no
                            longer need to cast read-only strings to 'char *'
                            when constructing this argument.
            execute         The prog_argv argument of the 'execute' function
                            is now of type 'const char * const *'.  You no
                            longer need to cast read-only strings to 'char *'
                            when constructing this argument.
            spawn-pipe      The prog_argv argument of the functions
                            'create_pipe_out', 'create_pipe_in',
                            'create_pipe_bidi' is now of type
                            'const char * const *'.  You no longer need to cast
                            read-only strings to 'char *' when constructing this
                            argument.
            pipe-filter-gi  The prog_argv argument of the
                            'pipe_filter_gi_create' function is now of type
                            'const char * const *'.  You no longer need to cast
                            read-only strings to 'char *' when constructing this
                            argument.
            pipe-filter-ii  The prog_argv argument of the
                            'pipe_filter_ii_execute' function is now of type
                            'const char * const *'.  You no longer need to cast
                            read-only strings to 'char *' when constructing this
                            argument.
            javaexec        The prog_argv argument of the 'execute_fn' function
                            type is now of type 'const char * const *'.  Update
                            the signature of all your implementations of this
                            type.
            csharpexec      The prog_argv argument of the 'execute_fn' function
                            type is now of type 'const char * const *'.  Update
                            the signature of all your implementations of this
                            type.

2020-12-02  spawn-pipe      The functions 'create_pipe_out', 'create_pipe_in',
                            'create_pipe_bidi' now take a 4th argument
                            'const char *directory'. To maintain the previous
                            behaviour, insert NULL as additional 4th argument.

2020-12-02  execute         The function 'execute' now takes a 4th argument
                            'const char *directory'. To maintain the previous
                            behaviour, insert NULL as additional 4th argument.

2020-10-16  hash            This module deprecates the 'hash_delete' function
                            using gcc's "deprecated" attribute.  Use the better-
                            named 'hash_remove' equivalent.

2020-08-24  diffseq         If you do not define NOTE_ORDERED to true,
                            the NOTE_DELETE and NOTE_INSERT actions might
                            not be done in order, to help cut down worst-case
                            recursion stack space from O(N) to O(log N).

2020-08-01  libtextstyle-optional  You now need to invoke
                                   gl_LIBTEXTSTYLE_OPTIONAL explicitly, because
                                   this macro now takes an optional
                                   MINIMUM-VERSION argument.

2020-08-01  libtextstyle    You now need to invoke gl_LIBTEXTSTYLE explicitly,
                            because this macro now takes an optional
                            MINIMUM-VERSION argument.

2020-06-27  clean-temp      The functions open_temp, fopen_temp now take a
                            'bool delete_on_close' argument. If in doubt, pass
                            false.

2020-06-27  tempname        The link requirements of these modules are changed
            mkdtemp         from empty to $(LIB_GETRANDOM).
            mkstemp
            mkstemps
            mkostemp
            mkostemps
            tmpfile
            stdlib-safer
            tmpfile-safer
            clean-temp
            javacomp        $(LIB_GETRANDOM) was added to the link requirements
                            of this module.

2020-05-27  read-file       The functions provided by this module now take an
                            'int flags' argument to modify the file reading
                            behavior.  The read_binary_file function has been
                            removed as it is no longer necessary.

2020-04-27  getdate         This deprecated module is removed. Use the module
                            'parse-datetime' instead. Instead of
                              #include "getdate.h"
                            write
                              #include "parse-datetime.h"
                            The function get_date is renamed to parse_datetime.

2020-04-27  realloc         This deprecated module is removed. Use the module
                            'realloc-gnu' instead.

2020-04-27  calloc          This deprecated module is removed. Use the module
                            'calloc-gnu' instead.

2020-04-27  malloc          This deprecated module is removed. Use the module
                            'malloc-gnu' instead.

2020-04-27  fnmatch-posix   This deprecated module is removed. Use the module
                            'fnmatch' instead.

2020-04-27  pipe            This deprecated module is removed. Use the module
                            'spawn-pipe' instead. Instead of
                              #include "pipe.h"
                            write
                              #include "spawn-pipe.h"

2020-04-27  getopt          This deprecated module is removed. Please choose
                            among getopt-posix and getopt-gnu. getopt-gnu
                            provides "long options" and "options with optional
                            arguments", getopt-posix doesn't.

2020-04-27  rename-dest-slash  This deprecated module is removed. Use the
                               module 'rename' instead.

2020-04-27  unictype/bidicategory-*  These deprecated modules are removed. Use
                                     the modules unictype/bidiclass-* instead.

2020-03-28  dosname         On native Windows, OS/2, DOS,
                            IS_RELATIVE_FILE_NAME("c:") now returns false.

2020-03-28  filename        The macro IS_ABSOLUTE_PATH is deprecated. Use
                            IS_ABSOLUTE_FILE_NAME instead.
                            The macro IS_PATH_WITH_DIR is deprecated. Use
                            IS_FILE_NAME_WITH_DIR instead.

2020-02-22  fchownat        This module no longer defines the functions
                            'chownat' and 'lchownat'.  Program that need these
                            functions should add the module 'chownat' to the
                            list of imported modules.

2020-02-22  fchmodat        This module no longer defines the functions
                            'chmodat' and 'lchmodat'.  Program that need these
                            functions should add the module 'chmodat' to the
                            list of imported modules.

2020-02-07  fchmodat        When applied to non-symlinks, these now act like
            lchmod          chmod (the BSD behavior, which POSIX requires for
                            fchmodat + AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW), instead of failing
                            (the GNU/Linux behavior through glibc 2.31).
                            Future versions of GNU/Linux are planned to act as
                            per POSIX and BSD.

2020-01-15  gc-pbkdf2-sha1  This module is deprecated.  Use gc-pbkdf2 instead.

2019-12-12  dfa             Its API now uses ptrdiff_t instead of size_t.

2019-12-11  dfa             To call dfamust, one must now call dfaparse
                            without yet calling dfacomp.  This fixes a bug
                            introduced on 2018-10-22 that broke dfamust.

2019-12-07  xstrtol         This module no longer defines the function
            xstrtoll        'xstrtol_fatal'.  Program that need this function
            xstrtoimax      should add the module 'xstrtol-error' to the list
            xstrtoumax      of imported modules.

2019-05-90  verify          verify_true (deprecated 2011-06-15) is removed.

2019-03-16  fatal-signal    The function that you pass to at_fatal_signal now
                            takes the signal as argument.

2019-02-02  c-strtod        This and related modules no longer define
                            the HAVE_C99_STRTOLD macro.  Programs requiring
                            standard strtold should use the strtold module.

2019-01-21  diacrit         This module is deprecated. Please use the module
                            uninorm/canonical-decomposition instead.

2018-10-23  backupfile      backup_file_rename and find_backup_file_name
                            now take an additional directory file descriptor
                            argument.  Pass AT_FDCWD to get the old behavior.

2018-08-18  getpass         The include file is changed from "getpass.h" to
            getpass-gnu     <unistd.h>.

2018-07-17  hard-locale     m4/hard-locale.m4 and gl_HARD_LOCALE are removed.

2018-07-05  renameat2       This module is renamed to 'renameatu' and all
                            its include files and functions are renamed
                            accordingly.

2017-12-30  chdir-safer     This module is removed.  It was deprecated
                            on 2006-07-17.

2017-11-24  posixtm         Previously, callers had to specify either
                            PDS_LEADING_YEAR or PDS_TRAILING_YEAR (but
                            not both).  Now, callers should specify
                            only PDS_TRAILING_YEAR; leading years are
                            requested by not specifying PDS_TRAILING_YEAR.

2017-08-14  fcntl-h         This module now defaults O_CLOEXEC to a nonzero
                            value instead of to 0, as the 'open' and
                            'openat' modules now emulate O_CLOEXEC.

2017-07-23  strftime        This module is renamed to 'nstrftime'.

2017-05-19  closeout        close_stdout longer closes stderr when addresses
                            are being sanitized, as the sanitizer outputs to
                            stderr afterwards.

2017-02-16  binary-io       On MS-DOS and OS/2, set_binary_mode now fails
                            on ttys, and sets errno == EINVAL.

2017-01-20  parse-datetime  The parse_datetime2 function now takes two
                            more arguments TZ and TZSTRING, for the
                            time zone and its name.

2017-01-16  host-cpu-c-abi  On ARM platforms, HOST_CPU_C_ABI is now set to
                            'arm' or 'armhf' instead of 'armel'.

2017-01-15  localeinfo      Change case_folded_counterparts's first arg's type
                            from wchar_t to wint_t, so it now accepts WEOF.

2016-12-17  getlogin        The link requirements of these modules are changed
            getlogin_r      from empty to $(LIB_GETLOGIN).

2016-12-13  dfa             Remove DFA_CASE_FOLD flag. Now based on RE_ICASE.

2016-11-17  unistr/u32-strmblen   The function u32_strmblen can now return -1.
2016-11-17  unistr/u32-strmbtouc  The function u32_strmbtouc can now return -1.

2016-08-17  stdbool         This no longer supports _Bool for C++.
                            Programs intended to be portable to C++
                            compilers should use plain 'bool' instead.

2016-04-12  intprops        The following macros were removed:
                            TYPE_TWOS_COMPLEMENT  TYPE_ONES_COMPLEMENT
                            TYPE_SIGNED_MAGNITUDE

2015-09-25  c-ctype         The following macros were removed:
                            C_CTYPE_CONSECUTIVE_DIGITS
                            C_CTYPE_CONSECUTIVE_LOWERCASE
                            C_CTYPE_CONSECUTIVE_UPPERCASE

2015-09-22  savewd          SAVEWD_CHDIR_READABLE constant removed.

2015-07-24  fprintftime     Exported functions' time zone arguments are now of
            strftime        type timezone_t (with NULL denoting UTC) instead of
                            type int (with nonzero denoting UTC).  These
                            modules now depend on time_rz.

2015-04-24  acl             This module no longer defines file_has_acl.
                            Use the new file-has-acl module for that.
                            Using only the latter module makes for fewer
                            link-time dependencies on GNU/Linux.

2015-04-15  acl             If your project only uses the file_has_acl()
                            detection routine, then the requirements are
                            potentially reduced by using $LIB_HAS_ACL rather
                            than $LIB_ACL.

2015-04-03  hash            hash_insert0 function removed (deprecated in 2011).

2014-10-29  obstack         The obstack functions are no longer limited to
                            int sizes; size values are now of type size_t.
                            This changes both the ABI and the API.
                            obstack_blank no longer accepts a negative size to
                            shrink the current object; callers must now use
                            obstack_blank_fast with a "negative" (actually,
                            large positive) size for that.

2014-02-23  diffseq         The members too_expensive, lo_minimal and hi_minimal
                            were removed from public structures, and the
                            find_minimal argument was removed from diag
                            and compareseq.

2014-02-11  savedir         The savedir and streamsavedir functions have a
                            new argument specifying how to sort the result.
                            The fdsavedir function is removed.

2013-05-04  gnulib-tool     CVS checkout of gnulib are no longer supported.

2013-02-08  careadlinkat    This module no longer provides the careadlinkatcwd
                            function.

2012-06-26  getopt-posix    This module no longer guarantees that option
                            processing is resettable.  If your code uses
                            'optreset' or 'optind = 0;', rewrite it to make
                            only one pass over the argument array.

2012-02-24  streq           This module no longer provides the STREQ macro.
                            Use STREQ_OPT instead.

2012-01-10  ignore-value    This module no longer provides the ignore_ptr
                            function.  It was deprecated a year ago, but existed
                            so briefly before then that it never came into use.
                            Now, the ignore_value function does its job.

2011-11-18  hash            This module deprecates the hash_insert0 function
                            using gcc's "deprecated" attribute.  Use the better-
                            named hash_insert_if_absent equivalent.

2011-11-04  openat          This module no longer provides the mkdirat()
                            function. If you need this function, you now need
                            to request the 'mkdirat' module.

2011-11-04  openat          This module no longer provides the fstatat()
                            function. If you need this function, you now need
                            to request the 'fstatat' module.

2011-11-03  openat          This module no longer provides the unlinkat()
                            function. If you need this function, you now need
                            to request the 'unlinkat' module.

2011-11-02  openat          This module no longer provides the fchmodat()
                            function. If you need this function, you now need
                            to request the 'fchmodat' module.

2011-11-01  alignof         This module no longer provides the alignof() macro.
                            Use either alignof_slot() or alignof_type() instead.

2011-11-01  openat          This module no longer provides the fchownat()
                            function. If you need this function, you now need
                            to request the 'fchownat' module.

2011-10-03  poll            The link requirements of this module are changed
                            from empty to $(LIB_POLL).

2011-09-25  sys_stat        This module no longer provides the fstat()
                            function. If you need this function, you now need
                            to request the 'fstat' module.

2011-09-23  signal          This module is renamed to 'signal-h'.

2011-09-22  select          The link requirements of this module are changed
                            from $(LIBSOCKET) to $(LIB_SELECT).

2011-09-12  fchdir          This module no longer overrides the functions
                            opendir() and closedir(), unless the modules
                            'opendir' and 'closedir' are in use, respectively.
                            If you use opendir(), please use module 'opendir'.
                            If you use closedir(), please use module 'closedir'.

2011-08-04  pathmax         The header file "pathmax.h" no longer defines
                            PATH_MAX on GNU/Hurd. Please use one of the methods
                            listed in pathmax.h to ensure your package is
                            portable to GNU/Hurd.

2011-07-24  close           This module no longer pulls in the 'fclose' module.
                            If your code creates a socket descriptor using
                            socket() or accept(), then a FILE stream referring
                            to it using fdopen(), then in order to close this
                            stream, you need the 'fclose' module.

2011-07-12  arg-nonnull     Renamed to snippet/arg-nonnull.
            c++defs         Renamed to snippet/c++defs.
            link-warning    Renamed to snippet/link-warning.
            unused-parameter Renamed to snippet/unused-parameter.
            warn-on-use     Renamed to snippet/warn-on-use.

2011-06-15  verify          verify_true (V) is deprecated; please use
                            verify_expr (V, 1) instead.

2011-06-05  ansi-c++-opt    When a C++ compiler is not found, the variable CXX
                            is now set to "no", not to ":".

2011-05-11  group-member    The include file is changed from "group-member.h"
                            to <unistd.h>.

2011-05-02  exit            The module is removed.  It was deprecated
                            on 2010-03-05.  Use 'stdlib' directly instead.

2011-04-27  mgetgroups      The 'xgetgroups' function has been split into
                            a new 'xgetgroups' module.

2011-04-27  save-cwd        This module pulls in fewer dependencies by
                            default; to retain robust handling of directories
                            with an absolute name longer than PATH_MAX, you
                            must now explicitly include the 'getcwd' module.

2011-04-19  close-hook      This module has been renamed to 'fd-hook' and
                            generalized.

2011-03-08  regex-quote     The last argument is no longer an 'int cflags'
                            but instead a pointer to a previously constructed
                            'struct regex_quote_spec'.

2011-02-25  dirname         These modules no longer put #defines for the
            dirname-lgpl    following symbols into <config.h>: ISSLASH,
            backupfile      FILE_SYSTEM_ACCEPTS_DRIVE_LETTER_PREFIX,
            lstat           FILE_SYSTEM_BACKSLASH_IS_FILE_NAME_SEPARATOR,
            openat          FILE_SYSTEM_DRIVE_PREFIX_CAN_BE_RELATIVE.
            remove          Applications that need ISSLASH can include the new
            rmdir           header dosname.h.
            savewd
            stat
            unlink

2011-02-14  getloadavg      This module no longer #defines C_GETLOADAVG or
                            HAVE_GETLOADAVG, as the application no longer needs
                            to worry about how getloadavg is defined.  It no
                            longer defines the obsolete symbol NLIST_NAME_UNION
                            (which should have been internal to the module
                            anyway).  Also, support for setgid use has been
                            removed, as nobody seems to be using it; thus
                            GETLOADAVG_PRIVILEGED is no longer #defined and
                            KMEM_GROUP and NEED_SETGID are no longer
                            substituted for.

2011-02-08  stdlib          Unless the random_r module is also used, this
                            module no longer guarantees that the following are
                            defined: struct random_data, RAND_MAX, random_r,
                            srandom_r, initstate_r, setstate_r.

2011-02-08  wctype-h        This module no longer provides the iswblank()
                            function. If you need this function, you now need
                            to request the 'iswblank' module.

2011-02-07  wctype          This module is renamed to wctype-h.

2011-01-18  multiarch       This no longer #defines AA_APPLE_UNIVERSAL_BUILD;
                            instead, use the shell var APPLE_UNIVERSAL_BUILD.

2010-12-10  pipe            This module is renamed to spawn-pipe. The include
                            file is renamed to "spawn-pipe.h".

2010-10-05  getdate         This module is deprecated. Please use the new
                            parse-datetime module for the replacement
                            function parse_datetime(), or help us write
                            getdate-posix for getdate(). Also, the header
                            "getdate.h" has been renamed "parse-datetime.h",
                            and doc/getdate.texi to doc/parse-datetime.texi.

2010-09-29  sys_wait        This module no longer provides the waitpid()
                            function. If you need this function, you now need
                            to request the 'waitpid' module.

2010-09-17  utimens         The function gl_futimens is removed, and its
                            signature has been migrated to fdutimens.  Callers
                            of gl_futimens should change function name, and
                            callers of fdutimens should swap parameter order.

2010-09-17  fdutimensat     This function has a new signature: the fd now comes
                            first instead of the dir/name pair, and a new
                            atflag parameter is added at the end.  Old code
                            should rearrange parameters, and pass 0 for atflag.

2010-09-13  regex           The module is not guaranteeing anymore support for
                            64-bit regoff_t on 64-bit systems.  The size of
                            regoff_t will always be 32-bit unless the program
                            is being configured --with-included-regex.  This
                            may change again in the future once glibc provides
                            this feature as well.

2010-09-12  savedir         The fdsavedir function is now deprecated.

2010-09-10  fcntl-h         This module now defaults O_CLOEXEC to 0, and
                            it defaults O_EXEC and O_SEARCH to O_RDONLY.
                            Use "#if O_CLOEXEC" instead of "#ifdef O_CLOEXEC".

2010-08-28  realloc         This module is deprecated. Use 'realloc-gnu'
                            instead. It will be removed 2012-01-01.

2010-08-28  calloc          This module is deprecated. Use 'calloc-gnu'
                            instead. It will be removed 2012-01-01.

2010-08-28  malloc          This module is deprecated. Use 'malloc-gnu'
                            instead. It will be removed 2012-01-01.

2010-08-14  memxfrm         This module is renamed to amemxfrm. The include
                            file is renamed to "amemxfrm.h". The function is
                            renamed to amemxfrm.

2010-08-09  symlinkat       This module now only provides symlinkat; use the
                            new module 'readlinkat' if needed.

2010-07-31  ansi-c++-opt    If Autoconf >= 2.66 is used, the 'configure'
                            option is now called --disable-c++ rather than
                            --disable-cxx.

2010-04-02  maintainer-makefile
                            The macro _prohibit_regexp has been revamped into
                            a new macro _sc_search_regexp; custom syntax
                            checks in your cfg.mk will need to be rewritten.

2010-03-28  lib-ignore      This module now provides a variable
                            IGNORE_UNUSED_LIBRARIES_CFLAGS that you should
                            add to LDFLAGS (when linking C programs only) or
                            CFLAGS yourself. It is no longer added to LDFLAGS
                            automatically.

2010-03-18  pty             This module now only declares the pty.h header.
                            Use the new modules 'forkpty' or 'openpty' to
                            get the functions that were previously provided.

2010-03-05  exit            This module is deprecated, use 'stdlib' directly
                            instead.  It will be removed 2011-01-01.

2009-12-13  sublist         The module does not define functions any more that
                            call xalloc_die() in out-of-memory situations. Use
                            module 'xsublist' and include file "gl_xsublist.h"
                            instead.

2009-12-13  list            The module does not define functions any more that
                            call xalloc_die() in out-of-memory situations.
                            Use module 'xlist' and include file "gl_xlist.h"
                            instead.

2009-12-13  oset            The module does not define functions any more that
                            call xalloc_die() in out-of-memory situations.
                            Use module 'xoset' and include file "gl_xoset.h"
                            instead.

2009-12-10  *               Most source code files have been converted to
                            indentation by spaces (rather than tabs). Patches
                            of gnulib source code needs to be updated.

2009-12-09  link-warning    The Makefile rules that use $(LINK_WARNING_H) now
                            must contain an explicit dependency on
                            $(LINK_WARNING_H).

2009-11-12  getgroups       These functions now use a signature of gid_t,
            getugroups      rather than GETGROUPS_T.  This probably has no
                            effect except on very old platforms.

2009-11-04  tempname        The gen_tempname function takes an additional
                            'suffixlen' argument. You can safely pass 0.

2009-11-04  nproc           The num_processors function now takes an argument.

2009-11-02  inet_pton       The use of this module now requires linking with
                            $(INET_PTON_LIB).

2009-11-02  inet_ntop       The use of this module now requires linking with
                            $(INET_NTOP_LIB).

2009-10-10  utimens         The use of this module now requires linking with
                            $(LIB_CLOCK_GETTIME).

2009-09-16  canonicalize-lgpl
                            The include file is changed from "canonicalize.h"
                            to <stdlib.h>.

2009-09-04  link-follow     The macro LINK_FOLLOWS_SYMLINK is now tri-state,
                            rather than only defined to 1.

2009-09-03  openat          The include files are standardized to POSIX 2008.
                            For openat, include <fcntl.h>; for
                            fchmodat, fstatat, and mkdirat, include
                            <sys/stat.h>; for fchownat and unlinkat,
                            include <unistd.h>.  For all other
                            functions provided by this module,
                            continue to include "openat.h".

2009-08-30  striconveh      The functions mem_cd_iconveh and str_cd_iconveh
                            now take an 'iconveh_t *' argument instead of three
                            iconv_t arguments.

2009-08-23  tempname        The gen_tempname function takes an additional
                            'flags' argument. You can safely pass 0.

2009-08-12  getopt          This module is deprecated. Please choose among
                            getopt-posix and getopt-gnu. getopt-gnu provides
                            "long options" and "options with optional
                            arguments", getopt-posix doesn't.

2009-06-25  fpurge          The include file is changed from "fpurge.h" to
                            <stdio.h>.

2009-04-26  modules/uniconv/u8-conv-from-enc
            modules/uniconv/u16-conv-from-enc
            modules/uniconv/u32-conv-from-enc
                            The calling convention of the functions
                            u*_conv_from_encoding is changed.

2009-04-26  modules/uniconv/u8-conv-to-enc
            modules/uniconv/u16-conv-to-enc
            modules/uniconv/u32-conv-to-enc
                            The calling convention of the functions
                            u*_conv_to_encoding is changed.

2009-04-24  maintainer-makefile
                            The maint.mk file was copied from
                            coreutils, and the old
                            coverage/gettext/indent rules were
                            re-added.  If you used 'make syntax-check'
                            this will add several new checks.  If some
                            new check is annoying, add the name of the
                            checks to 'local-checks-to-skip' in your
                            cfg.mk.

2009-04-01  visibility      Renamed to lib-symbol-visibility.

2009-04-01  ld-version-script  Renamed to lib-symbol-versions.

2009-03-20  close           The substituted variable LIB_CLOSE is removed.

2009-03-05  filevercmp      Move hidden files up in ordering.

2009-01-22  c-strtod        This function no longer calls xalloc_die(). If
            c-strtold       you want to exit the program in case of out-of-
                            memory, the calling function needs to arrange
                            for it, like this:
                                errno = 0;
                                val = c_strtod (...);
                                if (val == 0 && errno == ENOMEM)
                                  xalloc_die ();

2009-01-17  relocatable-prog  In the Makefile.am or Makefile.in, you now also
                            need to set RELOCATABLE_STRIP = :.

2008-12-22  getaddrinfo     When using this module, you now need to link with
            canon-host      $(GETADDRINFO_LIB).

2008-12-21  mbiter          The header files "mbiter.h", "mbuiter.h",
            mbuiter         "mbfile.h" can now be included without checking
            mbfile          HAVE_MBRTOWC. The macro HAVE_MBRTOWC will no
                            longer be defined by these modules in a year. If
                            you want to continue to use it, you need to invoke
                            AC_FUNC_MBRTOWC yourself.

2008-11-11  warnings        This module subsumes the file m4/warning.m4 which
                            was removed.

2008-10-20  lstat           The include file is changed from "lstat.h" to
                            <sys/stat.h>.

2008-10-20  getaddrinfo     The include file is changed from "getaddrinfo.h"
                            to <netdb.h>.

2008-10-19  isnanf          The include file is changed from "isnanf.h" to
                            <math.h>.
            isnand          The include file is changed from "isnand.h" to
                            <math.h>.
            isnanl          The include file is changed from "isnanl.h" to
                            <math.h>.

2008-10-18  lchmod          The include file is changed from "lchmod.h" to
                            <sys/stat.h>.

2008-10-18  dirfd           The include file is changed from "dirfd.h" to
                            <dirent.h>.

2008-10-18  euidaccess      The include file is changed from "euidaccess.h"
                            to <unistd.h>.

2008-10-18  getdomainname   The include file is changed from "getdomainname.h"
                            to <unistd.h>.

2008-09-28  sockets         When using this module, you now need to link with
                            $(LIBSOCKET).

2008-09-24  sys_select      The limitation on 'select', introduced 2008-09-23,
                            was removed.  sys_select now includes a select
                            wrapper for Winsock.  The wrapper expects socket
                            and file descriptors to be compatible as arranged
                            by the sys_socket on MinGW.

2008-09-23  sys_socket      Under Windows (MinGW), the module now adds
                            wrappers around Winsock functions, so that
                            socket descriptors are now compatible with
                            file descriptors.  In general, this change
                            will simply improve your code's portability
                            between POSIX platforms and Windows.  In
                            particular, you will be able to use ioctl and
                            close instead of ioctlsocket and closesocket,
                            and test errno instead of WSAGetLastError ().
                            On the other hand, you have to audit your code to
                            remove usage of these Winsock-specific functions.

                            This change does not remove the need to call
                            the gl_sockets_startup function from the sockets
                            gnulib module.  Also, for now select is disabled
                            when you include the sys_socket module; while
                            the functionality will be restored soon, for
                            efficiency it is suggested to use the poll system
                            poll system call and gnulib module instead.

2008-09-13  EOVERFLOW       The module is removed. Use module errno instead.

2008-09-01  filename        The module does not define the function
                            concatenated_filename any more. To get an
                            equivalent function, use function
                            xconcatenated_filename from module
                            'xconcat-filename'.

2008-08-31  havelib         On Solaris, when searching for 64-bit mode
                            libraries the directory $prefix/lib is now ignored.
                            Instead the directory $prefix/lib/64 is searched.
                            You may need to create a symbolic link for
                            $prefix/lib/64 if you have 64-bit libraries
                            installed in $prefix/lib.

2008-08-19  strverscmp      The include file is changed from "strverscmp.h"
                            to <string.h>.

2008-08-14  lock            The include file is changed from "lock.h"
                            to "glthread/lock.h".
            tls             The include file is changed from "tls.h"
                            to "glthread/tls.h".

2008-07-17  c-stack         The module now requires the addition of
                            $(LIBCSTACK) or $(LTLIBCSTACK) in Makefile.am,
                            since it may depend on linking with libsigsegv.

2008-07-07  isnanf-nolibm   The include file is changed from "isnanf.h"
                            to "isnanf-nolibm.h".
            isnand-nolibm   The include file is changed from "isnand.h"
                            to "isnand-nolibm.h".

2008-06-10  execute         The execute function takes an additional termsigp
                            argument. Passing termsigp = NULL is ok.
            wait-process    The wait_subprocess function takes an additional
                            termsigp argument. Passing termsigp = NULL is ok.

2008-05-10  linebreak       The module is split into several modules unilbrk/*.
                            The include file is changed from "linebreak.h" to
                            "unilbrk.h". Two functions are renamed:
                            mbs_possible_linebreaks -> ulc_possible_linebreaks
                            mbs_width_linebreaks -> ulc_width_linebreaks

2008-04-28  rpmatch         The include file is now <stdlib.h>.

2008-04-28  inet_ntop       The include file is changed from "inet_ntop.h"
                            to <arpa/inet.h>.

2008-04-28  inet_pton       The include file is changed from "inet_pton.h"
                            to <arpa/inet.h>.

2008-03-06  freadahead      The return value's computation has changed. It
                            now increases by 1 after ungetc.

2008-01-26  isnan-nolibm    The module name is changed from isnan-nolibm to
                            isnand-nolibm. The include file is changed from
                            "isnan.h" to "isnand.h". The function that it
                            defines is changed from isnan() to isnand().

2008-01-14  strcasestr      This module now replaces worst-case inefficient
                            implementations; clients that use controlled
                            needles and thus do not care about worst-case
                            efficiency should use the new strcasestr-simple
                            module instead for smaller code size.

2008-01-09  alloca-opt      Now defines HAVE_ALLOCA_H only when the system
                            supplies an <alloca.h>.  Gnulib-using code is now
                            expected to include <alloca.h> unconditionally.
                            Non-gnulib-using code can continue to include
                            <alloca.h> only if HAVE_ALLOCA_H is defined.

2008-01-08  memmem          This module now replaces worst-case inefficient
                            implementations; clients that use controlled
                            needles and thus do not care about worst-case
                            efficiency should use the new memmem-simple
                            module instead for smaller code size.

2007-12-24  setenv          The include file is changed from "setenv.h" to
                            <stdlib.h>. Also, the unsetenv function is no
                            longer declared in this module; use the 'unsetenv'
                            module if you need it.

2007-12-03  getpagesize     The include file is changed from "getpagesize.h"
                            to <unistd.h>.

                            <strings.h>.

2007-10-07  most modules    The license for most modules has changed from
                            GPLv2+ to GPLv3+, and from LGPLv2+ to LGPLv3+.
                            A few modules are still under LGPLv2+; see the
                            module description for the applicable license.

2007-09-01  linebreak       "linebreak.h" no longer declares the functions
                            locale_charset, uc_width, u{8,16,32}_width. Use
                            "uniwidth.h" to get these functions declared.

2007-08-28  areadlink-with-size
                            Renamed from mreadlink-with-size.
                            Function renamed: mreadlink_with_size ->
                            areadlink_with_size.

2007-08-22  getdelim, getline
                            The include file is changed from "getdelim.h"
                            and "getline.h" to the POSIX 200x <stdio.h>.

2007-08-18  idcache         Now provides prototypes in "idcache.h".

2007-08-10  xstrtol         The STRTOL_FATAL_ERROR macro is removed.
                            Use the new xstrtol_fatal function instead.

2007-08-04  human           The function human_options no longer reports an
                            error to standard error; that is now the
                            caller's responsibility.  It returns an
                            error code of type enum strtol_error
                            instead of the integer option value, and stores
                            the option value via a new int * argument.
            xstrtol         The first two arguments of STRTOL_FATAL_ERROR
                            are now an option name and option argument
                            instead of an option argument and a type string,
                            STRTOL_FAIL_WARN is removed.

2007-07-14  gpl, lgpl       New Texinfo versions with no sectioning commands.

2007-07-10  version-etc     Output now mentions GPLv3+, not GPLv2+.  Use
                            gnulib-tool --local-dir to override this.

2007-07-07  wcwidth         The include file is changed from "wcwidth.h" to
                            <wchar.h>.

                            was renamed to "xmalloca.h". The function was
                            renamed:
                              xallocsa -> xmalloca

2007-06-09  allocsa         Renamed to malloca. The include file "allocsa.h"
                            was renamed to "malloca.h". The function-like
                            macros were renamed:
                              allocsa -> malloca
                              freesa -> freea

2007-05-20  utimens         Renamed futimens to gl_futimens, to avoid
                            conflict with the glibc-2.6-introduced function
                            that has a different signature.

2007-05-01  sigprocmask     The module now depends on signal, so replace
                              #include "sigprocmask.h"
                            with
                              #include <signal.h>

2007-04-06  gettext         The macro HAVE_LONG_DOUBLE is no longer set.
                            You can replace all its uses with 1, i.e. assume
                            'long double' as a type exists.

2007-04-01  arcfour         Renamed to crypto/arcfour.

            sha1            Renamed to crypto/sha1.

2007-03-27  vasprintf       The module now depends on stdio, so replace
                               #include "vasprintf.h"
                            with

2007-03-19  iconvme         The module is removed. Use module striconv instead:
                            iconv_string -> str_iconv
                            iconv_alloc -> str_cd_iconv (with reversed
                                           arguments)

2007-03-15  list            The functions gl_list_create_empty and
            array-list      gl_list_create now take an extra fourth argument.
            carray-list     You can pass NULL.
            linked-list
            linkedhash-list

            array-oset      third argument. You can pass NULL.
            avltree-oset
            rbtree-oset

2007-03-12  des             The types and functions in lib/des.h have been
            gc-des          renamed:

                            des_ctx -> gl_des_ctx, tripledes_ctx -> gl_3des_ctx,
                            des_is_weak_key -> gl_des_is_weak_key,
                            des_setkey -> gl_des_setkey,

                            Also consider using the "gc-des" buffer instead of
                            using the "des" module directly.

2007-02-28  xreadlink       The module xreadlink was renamed to

                              #include "strdup.h"
                            with

/* The macros in this file implement multi-byte character representation
   and forward iteration through a multi-byte string.
   They are simpler and can be faster than the mbiter family.
   However, they do not support obsolescent encodings like CP864,
   EBCDIC, Johab, and Shift JIS that glibc also does not support,
   and it is up to the caller to coalesce encoding-error bytes if desired.
   The value of errno is unspecified after calls to these macros.

   The mcel_scan function lets code iterate through an array of bytes,
   supporting character encodings in practical use
   more simply than using plain mbrtoc32.

   Instead of this single-byte code:

      char *p = ..., *lim = ...;
      for (; p < lim; p++)
        process (*p);

   You can use this multi-byte code:

      char *p = ..., *lim = ...;
      for (mcel_t g; p < lim; p += g.len)
        {
          g = mcel_scan (p, lim);
          process (g);
        }

   You can select from G using G.ch, G.err, and G.len.
   G is an encoding error if G.err is nonzero, a character otherwise.
   Note G.err may occur even in the "C" locale on some systems.
   In any case G.len will be 1 if G.err is set.

   The mcel_scanz function is similar except it works with a
   string of unknown but positive length that is terminated with '\0'.
   Instead of this single-byte code:

      char *p = ...;
      for (; *p; p++)
        process (*p);

   You can use this multi-byte code:

      char *p = ...;
      for (mcel_t g; *p; p += g.len)
        {
          g = mcel_scanz (p);
          process (g);
        }

   mcel_scant (P, TERMINATOR) is like mcel_scanz (P) except the
   string is terminated by TERMINATOR.  The C standard says that the
   TERMINATORs '\0', '\r', '\n', '.', '/' are safe, as they cannot be
   a part (even a trailing byte) of a multi-byte character.
   In practice TERMINATOR is safe if 0 <= TERMINATOR <= 0x2f (ASCII '/').

   mcel_ch (CH, LEN) and mcel_err (ERR) construct mcel_t values.

   mcel_cmp (G1, G2) compares two mcel_t values lexicographically by
   character or by encoding byte value, with encoding bytes sorting
   after characters.

   Calls like c32isalpha (G.ch) test G; they return false for encoding
   errors since calls like c32isalpha (0) return false.  Calls like
   mcel_tocmp (c32tolower, G1, G2) are like mcel_cmp (G1, G2),
   but transliterate first.

   Although ISO C and POSIX allow encodings that have shift states or
   that can produce multiple characters from an indivisible byte sequence,
   POSIX does not require support for these encodings,
   they are not in practical use on GNUish platforms,
   and omitting support for them simplifies the API.  */

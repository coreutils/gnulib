Gnulib module: execvp

Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
On Windows platforms (excluding Cygwin), this function does not pass
command-line arguments correctly if they contain space, tab, backslash,
or double-quote characters.
@item
On Windows platforms (excluding Cygwin), this function spawns an asynchronous
child process and then exits the current process immediately.  As a
consequence, the parent of the current process 1. may incorrectly proceed
as if its child had exited, and 2. will never see the child's exit status.
@item
On Windows platforms (excluding Cygwin), the return type of this function is
@code{intptr_t}, not @code{int}.
@end itemize

Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
On some platforms, a script without executable permission is still run:
Cygwin 1.5.x.

# This program creates a program's manual from the .x skeleton and its --help
# output.
#
# Usage: x-to-1 [OPTIONS] PERL HELP2MAN EXECUTABLE PROGRAM.x PROGRAM.1
# where
#
#   PERL        The file name of the perl program.
#   HELP2MAN    Either the file name of the help2man perl script, or a complete
#               command such as "$PERL -w -- help2man".
#   EXECUTABLE  The file name of the program to invoke with --help.
#   PROGRAM     The name of the program.
#   PROGRAM.x   The .x skeleton is a file containing manual page text that is
#               not part of the --help output. It is passed to help2man via
#               its --include option. Its format is described in the help2man
#               documentation.
#   PROGRAM.1   The output file, a manual page in mandoc format.
#
# Options:
#   --update    Don't overwrite the output if nothing would change.

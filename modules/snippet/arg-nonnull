Description:
A C macro for declaring that specific arguments must not be NULL.

Applicability:
all

Files:
build-aux/snippet/arg-nonnull.h

Depends-on:

configure.ac:

Makefile.am:
# The BUILT_SOURCES created by this Makefile snippet are not used via #include
# statements but through direct file reference. Therefore this snippet must be
# present in all Makefile.am that need it. This is ensured by the applicability
# 'all' defined above.

BUILT_SOURCES += arg-nonnull.h
# The arg-nonnull.h that gets inserted into generated .h files is the same as
# build-aux/snippet/arg-nonnull.h, except that it has the copyright header cut
# off.
arg-nonnull.h: $(top_srcdir)/build-aux/snippet/arg-nonnull.h

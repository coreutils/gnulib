Gnulib module: faccessat

Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:

@item
This function is missing on some platforms:
glibc 2.3.6, Mac OS X 10.5, FreeBSD 6.0, NetBSD 5.0, OpenBSD 3.8, Minix 3.1.8,
AIX 5.1, HP-UX 11, IRIX 6.5, OSF/1 5.1, Solaris 10, Cygwin 1.5.x, mingw, MSVC 9,
Interix 3.5, BeOS.
However, the replacement does not always take into account ACLs.  Also,
it is not safe to be used in libraries and is not multithread-safe.

Note: A future revision of POSIX later than the 2008/2009 one may drop the
functions @code{_setjmp} and @code{_longjmp}.  Still, in 2008, on all
systems which have @code{_setjmp}, it is the fastest way to save the
registers but not the signal mask (up to 30 times faster than @code{setjmp}
on some systems).

  I'll write a separate module for that part.

  I think we should even add a good PRNG that is re-seeded from
  /dev/?random frequently.  GnuTLS can need a lot of random data on a
  big server, more than /dev/random can supply.  And /dev/urandom might
  not be strong enough.  Further, the security of /dev/?random can also
  be questionable.

  There is none, that is the problem.

  Applications generally need different kind of "random" numbers.
  Sometimes they just need some random data and doesn't care whether it
  is possible for an attacker to compute the string (aka a "nonce").
  Sometimes they need data that is very difficult to compute (i.e.,
  computing it require inverting SHA1 or similar).  Sometimes they need
  data that is not possible to compute, i.e., it wants real entropy
  collected over time on the system.  Collecting the last kind of random
  data is very expensive, so it must not be used too often.  The second
  kind of random data ("pseudo random") is typically generated by
  seeding a good PRNG with a couple of hundred bytes of real entropy
  from the "real random" data pool.  The "nonce" is usually computed
  using the PRNG as well, because PRNGs are usually fast.

  Pseudo-random data is typically used for session keys.  Strong random
  data is often used to generate long-term keys (e.g., private RSA
  keys).

  Of course, there are many subtleties.  There are several different
  kind of nonce:s.  Sometimes a nonce is just an ever-increasing
  integer, starting from 0.  Sometimes it is assumed to be unlikely to
  be the same as previous nonces, but without a requirement that the
  nonce is possible to guess.  MD5(system clock) would thus suffice, if
  it isn't called too often.  You can guess what the next value will be,
  but it will always be different.

  The problem is that /dev/?random doesn't offer any kind of semantic
  guarantees.  But applications need an API that make that promise.

  I think we should do this in several steps:

  1) Write a module that can read from /dev/?random.

  2) Add a module for a known-good PRNG suitable for random number
  generation, that can be continuously re-seeded.

  3) Add a high-level module that provide various different randomness
  functions.  One for nonces, perhaps even different kind of nonces,
  one for pseudo random data, and one for strong random data.  It is
  not clear whether we can hope to achieve the last one in a portable
  way.

  Further, it would be useful to allow users to provide their own
  entropy source as a file, used to seed the PRNG or initialize the
  strong randomness pool.  This is used on embedded platforms that
  doesn't have enough interrupts to hope to generate good random data.

  > For example, why not use OpenBSD's /dev/arandom?

  I don't trust ARC4.  For example, recent cryptographic efforts
  indicate that you must throw away the first 512 bytes generated from
  the PRNG for it to be secure.  I don't know whether OpenBSD do this.
  Further, I recall some eprint paper on RC4 security that didn't
  inspire confidence.

  While I trust the random devices in OpenBSD more than
  Solaris/AIX/HPUX/etc, I think that since we need something better on
  Solaris/AIX/HPUX we'd might as well use it on OpenBSD or even Linux
  too.

  I'm not sure this is a good idea.  Users can't really be expected to
  understand this.  Further, applications need many different kind of
  random data.  Selecting the randomness level for each by the user will
  be too complicated.

  I think it is better if the application decide, from its cryptographic
  requirement, what entropy quality it require, and call the proper API.
  Meeting the implied semantic properties should be the job for gnulib.

  Agreed.

  This may require some thinking before it is finalized.  Is it ok to
  install the GC module as-is meanwhile?  Then I can continue to add the
  stuff that GnuTLS need, and then come back to re-working the
  randomness module.  That way, we have two different projects that use
  the code.  GnuTLS includes the same randomness code that was in GNU
  SASL and that is in the current gc module.  I feel much more
  comfortable working in small steps at a time, rather then working on
  this for a long time in gnulib and only later integrate the stuff in
  GnuTLS.

  Thanks,
  Simon

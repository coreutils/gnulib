Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
Under BeOS, Gnulib's @code{poll} replacement can only be called on descriptors
created by the @code{socket} function, not on regular file descriptors.

@item
Under Windows, when passing a pipe, Gnulib's @code{poll} replacement might
return 0 even before the timeout has passed.  Programs using it with pipes can
thus busy wait.

@item
Under HP NonStop, file descriptors other than sockets do not support
POLLHUP; they will return a "readable" status instead.

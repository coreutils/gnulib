Gnulib module: renameat

Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
This function does not reject trailing slashes on non-directories on
some platforms, as in @code{renameat(fd,"file",fd,"new/")}:
Solaris 11 2011-11.
@item
This function ignores trailing slashes on symlinks on some platforms,
such that @code{renameat(fd,"link/",fd,"new")} corrupts @file{link}:
Solaris 9.
@item
This function is declared in @code{<unistd.h>} instead of @code{<stdio.h>}
on some platforms:
Solaris 11 2011-11.
@item
This function is missing on some platforms:
glibc 2.3.6, Mac OS X 10.5, FreeBSD 6.0, NetBSD 5.0, OpenBSD 3.8, Minix 3.1.8,
AIX 5.1, HP-UX 11, IRIX 6.5, OSF/1 5.1, Solaris 8, Cygwin 1.5.x, mingw, MSVC 9,
Interix 3.5, BeOS.
But the replacement function is not safe to be used in libraries and is not multithread-safe.

Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
POSIX requires that @code{renameat(fd,"symlink-to-dir/",fd,"dir2")} rename
@file{dir} and leave @file{symlink-to-dir} dangling; likewise, it
requires that @code{renameat(fd,"dir",fd,"dangling/")} rename @file{dir} so
that @file{dangling} is no longer a dangling symlink.  This behavior
is counter-intuitive, so on some systems, @code{renameat} fails with
@code{ENOTDIR} if either argument is a symlink with a trailing slash:
glibc, OpenBSD, Cygwin 1.7.
@item
After renaming a non-empty directory over an existing empty directory,
the old directory name is still visible through the @code{stat} function
for 30 seconds after the rename, on NFS file systems, on some platforms:
Linux 2.6.18.
@item
This function will not rename a source that is currently opened
by any process:
mingw, MSVC 9.

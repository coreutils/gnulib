Gnulib module: lstat
@mindex lstat

Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
On platforms where @code{off_t} is a 32-bit type, @code{lstat} may not
correctly report the size of files or block devices 2 GiB and larger.
@xref{Large File Support}.
@item
On Linux/x86 and Linux/x86_64, applications compiled in 32-bit mode cannot
access files that happen to have a 64-bit inode number.  This can occur with
file systems such as XFS (typically on large disks) and NFS.
@xref{Large File Support}.
@item
For symlinks, when the argument ends in a slash, some platforms don't
dereference the argument:
Solaris 9.
@item
On some platforms, @code{lstat("file/",buf)} succeeds instead of
failing with @code{ENOTDIR}.
macOS 14, Solaris 9.
@item
On macOS 12.6, when this function yields a timestamp with a
nonpositive @code{tv_sec} value, @code{tv_nsec} might be in the range
@minus{}999999999..@minus{}1, representing a negative nanoseconds
offset from @code{tv_sec}.  Solaris 11.4 is similar, except that
@code{tv_sec} might also be @minus{}1000000000.
@item
On Windows platforms (excluding Cygwin), a different name has to be used
for the null device, namely @code{"NUL"} instead of @code{"/dev/null"}.
@item
On Windows platforms (excluding Cygwin), symlinks are not supported, so
@code{lstat} does not exist.

Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:

@xref{sys/stat.h}, for general portability problems with @code{struct stat}.

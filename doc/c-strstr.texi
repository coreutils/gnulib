The @code{c-strstr} module contains a substring search function operating
on single-byte character strings, that operate as if the locale encoding
was ASCII.
(The "C" locale on many systems has the locale encoding "ASCII".)

The function is:
@smallexample
extern char *c_strstr (const char *haystack, const char *needle);
@end smallexample

Note: The function @code{strstr} from @code{<string.h>} supports only
unibyte locales; for multibyte locales, you need the function
@code{mbsstr}.

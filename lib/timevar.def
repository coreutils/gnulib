/* This file contains the list of timing variable definitions, used by
   timevar.h and timevar.c.

   Syntax:

     DEFTIMEVAR (Id, Name)

   where:

   - Id is the value used to identify the timing variable.
     It's an enum value, i.e., behaves like a nonnegative integer.
     It is used only the manipulate the timer: the user of the
     program will never see this identifier.

   - Name is a string describing its purpose.  This string
     will be presented to the user in the timing tables.  It does not
     need to be a literal, you may for instance use gettext.

   The order of this list matters: that is the order in which the
   timing table is printed, except that 'tv_total' is printed last.

/* The total execution time.  Mandatory.  */
DEFTIMEVAR (tv_total,      "total time")

/* Examples.  */
DEFTIMEVAR (tv_read,       "read")

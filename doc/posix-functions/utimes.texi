Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
This function is missing on some platforms:
Minix 3.1.8, mingw, MSVC 9, Interix 3.5, BeOS.
@item
The declaration of this function lacks @code{const} in the second argument
on some platforms:
OSF/1 5.1.
@item
On some platforms, this function mis-handles trailing slash:
FreeBSD 7.2, Solaris 9.
@item
This function cannot set full timestamp resolution.  In particular,
some platforms incorrectly round rather than truncate.  Use
@code{utimensat(AT_FDCWD,file,times,0)}, or the gnulib module utimens,
instead.
@item
On some platforms, @code{utimes (file, NULL)} fails to set the
file's timestamp to the current time:
glibc 2.3.3.
@item
On some platforms, @code{utimes} failed on read-only files when
@code{utime} worked fine.
glibc 2.2.5.
@item
On OS/2, this function cannot set the timestamp to earlier than the
year 1980 in local time.
@item
On OS/2, this function cannot set the timestamp to an odd number of
seconds.
@item
On OS/2, this function does not work on an opened file.
@end itemize

Extension: Gnulib provides a module @samp{utimens} that works around these
problems and allows to set the time with nanosecond resolution (as far as
supported by the file system).

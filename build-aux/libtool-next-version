# This program is a wizard that helps a maintainer update the libtool
# version of a shared library, according to the documentation section
# 'Updating version info'
# <https://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual/html_node/Updating-version-info.html>.
#
# Let's call the three parts of the version
#   LTV_CURRENT
#   LTV_REVISION
#   LTV_AGE
#
# The list of steps given in this documentation section
#   - If the library source code has changed at all since the last update,
#     then increment LTV_REVISION.
#   - If any interfaces have been added, removed, or changed since the last
#     update, increment LTV_CURRENT and set LTV_REVISION to 0.
#   - If any interfaces have been added since the last public release, then
#     increment LTV_AGE.
#   - If any interfaces have been removed or changed since the last public
#     release, then set LTV_AGE to 0.
# leads to mistakes, because
#   - It does not say what "interfaces" are.
#   - It does not enforce that applying the second, third, or fourth rule
#     is only possible after applying the first rule.
#   - It does not enforce that applying the third or fourth rule is only

Usage: libtool-next-version [OPTION]... PREVIOUS-LIBRARY CURRENT-LIBRARY

Determines the next version to use for a libtool library.

PREVIOUS-LIBRARY is the installed library (in .a or .so format) of the
previous release.

CURRENT-LIBRARY is the installed library (in .a or .so format) of the current
release candidate.

Options:
      --help           print this help and exit
      --version        print version information and exit

Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
This header file is missing on some platforms:
mingw, MSVC 9.
@item
This header file is not self-contained on some platforms: it requires
@code{<sys/types.h>} to be included first.
@item
This header file does not define the type @code{socklen_t} on some platforms:
HP-UX 10.20, IRIX 6.5, OSF/1 4.0, Interix 3.5, BeOS.
@item
This header file does not define the type @code{struct iovec} on some platforms:
OpenBSD 4.4.
@item
This header file is lacking the @code{SHUT_RD}, @code{SHUT_WR},
@code{SHUT_RDWR} macros on some platforms, despite having the @code{shutdown}
functions:
emx+gcc.
@item
The @code{struct sockaddr_storage} type does not have a member @code{ss_family}
on some platforms:
AIX 7.1.

Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
This header file does not declare the @code{msg_control} and
@code{msg_controllen} members of @code{struct msghdr} on some
platforms.  This can be detected by the absence of the
@code{CMSG_FIRSTHDR} macro:
gnulib replacement header, old BSD

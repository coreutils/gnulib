Description:
A C macro for emitting link time warnings.

Applicability:
all

Files:
build-aux/snippet/link-warning.h

Depends-on:
gen-header

configure.ac:
AC_REQUIRE([gl_FEATURES_H])
AC_PROG_MKDIR_P

Makefile.am:
# The BUILT_SOURCES created by this Makefile snippet are not used via #include
# statements but through direct file reference. Therefore this snippet must be
# present in all Makefiles that need it. This is ensured by the applicability
# 'all' defined above.

# FIXME: The link-warning.h rule probably does not work if
# gnulib-tool's --gnu-make option is used, when the build is an
# out-of-source build that relies on VPATH.

# Check for files in directory $1 being up to date, according to the
# list on stdin.  Don't actually make any changes, just show the diffs.
#
# Empty (or only whitespace) input lines are ignored.
# Lines beginning with # are ignored.
# Lines with just one word are ignored.
# Otherwise, the line has two or more whitespace-separated words:
#   the first word is the source, the second word is the destination,
#   other optional words are options.
# The possible options are "gpl" (to replace the license with the GPL)
#   and "doclicense" (to replace @include doclicense.texi with fdl.texi).
#   Unrecognized options are ignored.
# $VARIABLE expansions are done (with sh eval).
#
# This script is used in gnulib and texinfo; the input files are named

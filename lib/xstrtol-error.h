/* Report an error for an invalid integer in an option argument.

   ERR is the error code returned by one of the xstrto* functions.

   Use OPT_IDX to decide whether to print the short option string "C"
   or "-C" or a long option string derived from LONG_OPTION.  OPT_IDX
   is -2 if the short option "C" was used, without any leading "-"; it
   is -1 if the short option "-C" was used; otherwise it is an index
   into LONG_OPTIONS, which should have a name preceded by two '-'
   characters.

   ARG is the option-argument containing the integer.

   After reporting an error, exit with a failure status.  */

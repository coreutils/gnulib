Description:
Reentrant time zone functions: localtime_rz, mktime_z, etc.

Comment:
This implements the NetBSD-inspired extensions to <time.h>, which
defines a type timezone_t and associated allocation functions tzalloc
and tzfree, along with two functions localtime_rz and mktime_z that
are like localtime_r and mktime except they have a new leading
timezone_t argument.  Time zone abbreviation strings have lifetimes
equal to the corresponding struct tm or timezone_t object (whichever
is less).  tzalloc (X) yields a time zone object equivalent to setting
the TZ environment variable to X.  tzalloc (NULL) is the same as an
unset TZ environment variable.  (timezone_t) 0 stands for UTC.

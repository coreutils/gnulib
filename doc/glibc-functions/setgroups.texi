This function is missing on some platforms:
AIX 5.1, mingw, MSVC 9, Interix 3.5, BeOS.
@item
On very old systems, this function operated on an array of @samp{int},
even though that was a different size than an array of @samp{gid_t};
you can use autoconf's AC_TYPE_GETGROUPS to set @code{GETGROUPS_T} to
the appropriate size (since @code{getgroups} and @code{setgroups}
share the same bug).

@findex __attribute__

This module provides a header file @file{attribute.h} that defines
macros related to C and C++ attributes and the GCC
@code{__attribute__} keyword.

Here is an example of its use:

@example
#include <attribute.h>

extern char *crypt (char const *, char const *)
  ATTRIBUTE_NOTHROW ATTRIBUTE_LEAF ATTRIBUTE_NONNULL ((1, 2));
@end example

@noindent
@code{ATTRIBUTE_NOTHROW} expands to @code{__attribute__
((__nothrow__))} if the compiler is a recent-enough GCC or GCC-like
compiler, and to nothing otherwise.  Similarly for
@code{ATTRIBUTE_LEAF}.  @code{ATTRIBUTE_NONNULL ((1, 2))} expands to
@code{__attribute__ ((__nonnull__ (1, 2)))} if the compiler is
recent-enough GCC, and to nothing otherwise.

Most of these attribute names begin with @code{ATTRIBUTE_}.
A few do not, because they are part of C2X and their
names are not likely to clash with other macro names.
These macros are @code{DEPRECATED}, @code{FALLTHROUGH},
@code{MAYBE_UNUSED}, and @code{NODISCARD}, which can
be defined to @code{[[deprecated]]} etc.@: on C2X platforms.

Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:

@item
This function is missing on some platforms:
Minix 3.1.8, Cygwin 1.5.x, mingw, MSVC 14, Android 6.0.
@item
On platforms where @code{off_t} is a 32-bit type, this function may not
work correctly across the entire data range of files larger than 2 GB.
The fix is to use the @code{AC_SYS_LARGEFILE} macro.

This function is missing on some platforms:
mingw, MSVC 9, BeOS.
@item
Attempts to @code{shmat} into a previously malloc-ed region fail on SunOS 4,
with @code{errno} set to @code{EINVAL}, even if there is an @code{munmap} call
in between.
@item
On Linux, the flag @code{SHM_REMAP} is needed in order to force @code{shmat}

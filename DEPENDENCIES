The following packages are needed by maintainers for using
'gnulib-tool'.  In general, Gnulib prefers the latest stable
version of each package, but in some cases it also supports
older versions; this caters to commonly-used software
distributions that may lag behind the latest stable package.
Support for older versions is not guaranteed, though, and
the version numbers in the following list may be incremented
at any time.

* A C runtime, compiler, linker, etc.
  + Mandatory. Using the platform's native 'cc' gives good portability
    exposure, but you can also use GCC 3.1 or newer.

* A 'make' utility.
  + Mandatory. Using the platform's native 'make' gives good portability
    exposure for in-tree builds, but VPATH builds require GNU Make 3.79.1 or
    newer.

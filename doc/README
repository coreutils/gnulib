How to update gnulib manual on www.gnu.org
------------------------------------------

1) You need a non-anonymous checkout of the web pages directory.

   $ cvs -d :ext:jas@cvs.savannah.gnu.org:/web/gnulib \
         checkout gnulib

2) Get familiar with the instructions for web page maintainers.
   http://www.gnu.org/server/standards/readme_index.html
   http://www.gnu.org/server/standards/README.software.html
   especially the note about symlinks.

3) Assuming GNULIB_CHECKOUT refers to a checkout of the gnulib dir,
   and      GNULIB_WWW_CHECKOUT refers to the other directory created above (1),
   do

   GNULIB_WWW_CHECKOUT=`cd $GNULIB_WWW_CHECKOUT && pwd`
   cd $GNULIB_CHECKOUT/doc
   make updated-stamp
   ../build-aux/gendocs.sh -o "$GNULIB_WWW_CHECKOUT/manual" \
     gnulib "The GNU Portability Library"
   cd $GNULIB_WWW_CHECKOUT

   Verify that the result looks sane.

4) Commit the modified and the new files.

5) Find the files which have not been overwritten (because they belonged
   to sections that have been removed or renamed):

   $ cd manual/html_node
   $ ls -lt

   Remove these files and commit their removal to CVS.
   For each of these files, add a line to the file .symlinks. This will
   ensure that hyperlinks to the removed files will redirect to the entire
   manual; this is better than a 404 error.

There is a problem with 'index.html' being written twice (once for POSIX
function 'index', once for the table of contents); you can ignore this issue.

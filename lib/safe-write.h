/* Some system calls may be interrupted and fail with errno = EINTR in the
   following situations:
     - The process is stopped and restarted (signal SIGSTOP and SIGCONT, user
       types Ctrl-Z) on some platforms: Mac OS X.
     - The process receives a signal for which a signal handler was installed
       with sigaction() with an sa_flags field that does not contain
       SA_RESTART.
     - The process receives a signal for which a signal handler was installed
       with signal() and for which no call to siginterrupt(sig,0) was done,
       on some platforms: AIX, HP-UX, Solaris.

   This module provides a wrapper around write() that handles EINTR.  */

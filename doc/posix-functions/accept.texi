Gnulib module: accept

Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
On Windows platforms (excluding Cygwin), the descriptors returned by
the @code{accept} function cannot be used in calls to @code{read},
@code{write}, and @code{close}; you have to use @code{recv}, @code{send},
@code{closesocket} in these cases instead.
@item
On Windows platforms (excluding Cygwin), error codes from this function
are not placed in @code{errno}, and @code{WSAGetLastError} must be used
instead.
@item
On HP-UX 11, in 64-bit mode, when the macro @code{_HPUX_ALT_XOPEN_SOCKET_API}
is not defined, this function behaves incorrectly because it is declared
to take a pointer to a 64-bit wide @code{socklen_t} entity but in fact
considers it as a pointer to a 32-bit wide @code{unsigned int} entity.

Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
Some platforms don't have a @code{socklen_t} type; in this case this function's
third argument type is @samp{int *}.
@item
On some platforms, this function's third argument type is @samp{void *},
not @samp{socklen_t *}:
Solaris 10.

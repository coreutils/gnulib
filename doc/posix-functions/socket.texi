Gnulib module: socket

Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
On Windows platforms (excluding Cygwin), the descriptors returned by
the @code{socket} function cannot be used in calls to @code{read},
@code{write}, and @code{close}; you have to use @code{recv}, @code{send},
@code{closesocket} in these cases instead.
@item
On Windows platforms (excluding Cygwin), error codes for @code{socket}
are not placed in @code{errno}, and @code{WSAGetLastError} must be
used instead.

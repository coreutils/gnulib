Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
This function is missing on some platforms:
MSVC 14, Android 5.1.
@item
On platforms where @code{long int} is a 32-bit type, this function may not
work correctly on huge directories larger than 2 GB@.  The fix is to use
the @code{AC_SYS_LARGEFILE} macro (only on Mac OS X systems).

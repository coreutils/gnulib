Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
@code{fflush}, @code{ftell}, @code{ftello}, @code{fgetpos} behave incorrectly
on input streams that are opened in @code{O_TEXT} mode and whose contents
contains Unix line terminators (LF), on some platforms: mingw, MSVC 9.
@item
On platforms where @code{off_t} is a 32-bit type, this function may not
work correctly on files larger than 2 GB.  The fix is to use the
@code{AC_SYS_LARGEFILE} macro.
@item
On platforms where @code{off_t} is a 64-bit type, but @code{fseeko} is
not present, stream operations on files larger than 2 GB silently do
the wrong thing.  This affects BSD/OS, which is mostly obsolete.

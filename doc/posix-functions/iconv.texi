Gnulib module: iconv

Portability problems fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
GNU libiconv is not found if installed in @file{$PREFIX/lib}.
@item
Failures are not distinguishable from successful returns on some platforms:
AIX 5.1, Solaris 10.
@item
A buffer overrun can occur on some platforms:
AIX 6.1..7.1.

Portability problems not fixed by Gnulib:
@itemize
@item
This function is missing on some platforms:
Mac OS X 10.5, FreeBSD 6.0, OpenBSD 3.8, Minix 3.1.8, IRIX 5.3, Cygwin, mingw, MSVC 9, BeOS,
when GNU libiconv is not installed.
@item
This function was not correctly implemented in glibc versions before 2.2.
@item
When @code{iconv} encounters an input character that is valid but that
cannot be converted to the output character set, glibc's and GNU libiconv's
@code{iconv} stop the conversion.  Some other implementations put an
implementation-defined character into the output buffer.
Gnulib provides higher-level facilities @code{striconv} and @code{striconveh}
(wrappers around @code{iconv}) that deal with conversion errors in a platform
independent way.
@item
This function returns a positive return value, instead of zero, when
converting from ISO-8859-1 to UTF-8 on HP-UX 11.
